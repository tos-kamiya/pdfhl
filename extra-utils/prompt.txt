{file.pdf} is a PDF file containing an academic paper.
By running the command `pdftopages FILE.pdf BASE`,
you will extract the text of each page into separate Markdown files named "BASE-nnn.md".
For more information, see the help output of `pdftopages --help`.
Afterwards, for each page, identify the important sentences and highlight them
using the `pdfhl` command.  Check the usage instructions with `pdfhl --help`.
Use the following three highlight colors:
* Blue - Sentences that describe the approach
* Green - Sentences that describe the experiment
* Red - Sentences that discuss threats to validity
