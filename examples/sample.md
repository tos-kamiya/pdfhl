# Overview

This pdfhl sample document contains a few repeated phrases so library examples can be executed immediately.

First, we mention the unique phrase **pdfhl sample document** only once so that BEST selection picks a single highlight.

Next, we describe the workflow twice to demonstrate ALL selection:

> This progressive highlight example shows how multiple matches are collected.
>
> Another progressive highlight example appears later to confirm that ALL selection highlights every occurrence.

Finally, the phrase **multiple times** appears, which you can use with SelectionMode.SINGLE if you want to stop when more than one match is detected.
