Session: 2025-09-13 â€” Implement experimental pdfhl CLI

- 10:45 Ran: `ls -la`
  Output:
  ```text
  (repo root listing with AGENTS.md, pyproject.toml, src/, tests/, dev-notes/)
  ```
  Why: Inspect repository layout

- 10:46 Ran: `rg --files -n`
  Output:
  ```text
  pyproject.toml
  LICENSE.txt
  README.md
  AGENTS.md
  tests/__init__.py
  dev-notes/discussion.md
  src/pdfhl/__about__.py
  src/pdfhl/__init__.py
  ```
  Result: Found discussion spec and package skeleton

- 10:47 Ran: `sed -n '1,200p' dev-notes/discussion.md`
  Output:
  ```text
  (spec and context for a CLI called pdfhl, highlighting PDFs robustly with PyMuPDF)
  ```
  Why: Extract CLI requirements

- 10:49 Ran: `sed -n '1,200p' pyproject.toml`
  Output:
  ```text
  (project metadata; no CLI entry yet)
  ```
  Result: Decide to add console script and dependency

Changes applied:
- Add CLI implementation at `src/pdfhl/pdfhl.py` implementing tolerant search, bbox grouping, and highlighting.
- Update `pyproject.toml` to require Python >=3.10, add dependency `pymupdf`, and console script `pdfhl`.
- Add tests for pure logic: `tests/test_text_normalization.py`, `tests/test_group_bboxes.py`.

Next:
- Optionally add JSON report and segmentation in future iterations.

Summary:
- Implemented experimental CLI per spec; added minimal tests for pure logic.

- 11:02 Ran: Fix ValueError from fitz.Quad by using 8-tuples
  Output:
  ```text
  Changed highlight quad construction to pass plain 8-tuples to add_highlight_annot.
  ```
  Why: User reported "Quad: bad seq len" on runtime

- 11:10 Ran: Fix "bad quads entry" by constructing fitz.Quad from Rect and sanitizing rects
  Output:
  ```text
  Build Quads via fitz.Rect -> fitz.Quad; ensure x0<x1,y0<y1 and non-zero extents.
  ```
  Why: Some environments reject raw 8-tuples; sanitize to avoid degenerate quads

- 11:20 Ran: Add JSON report switch
  Output:
  ```text
  --report json prints a machine-readable summary with hits (page, ranges, rects).
  Context includes original query and compiled pattern.
  ```
  Next: Consider adding segmentation and palette file support.

- 11:28 Ran: Switch back to 8-tuple quads with sanitization
  Output:
  ```text
  Build quads as 8-tuples after rect sanitization to avoid Quad(Point) init errors.
  ```
  Why: User hit a Quad constructor error on their PyMuPDF build

- 11:36 Ran: Fix quad point order and add fallback
  Output:
  ```text
  Use (ul, ur, ll, lr) ordering for quads. If add_highlight_annot still fails, fallback to semi-transparent rect annotations per line.
  ```
  Result: Improves compatibility across PyMuPDF versions and ensures annotation.
