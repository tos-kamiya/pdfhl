Scope: Library API design for PDF highlighting module.

- Topic: Library API surface for pdfhl
  - Decision: Propose a dataclass-based recipe API around `pdfhl.document.PdfDocument` with `HighlightSpec`, `ProgressiveSearchOptions`, and structured `HighlightResult` payloads, plus pure helper modules for normalization and search re-use.
  - Rationale: Aligns CLI behavior with importable workflows, keeps pure search utilities testable, and makes future extensions (batch ops, dry-run/reporting) explicit without breaking existing CLI paths.
  - Alternatives Considered: Exposing only a single `highlight_pdf()` function; rejected because it limits incremental control (e.g., inspecting matches without saving, multiple documents per process).
- Topic: Simplified single-function API request
  - Decision: Propose a lightweight `pdfhl.highlight_text(pdf_path, text, *, output=None, color=None, label=None, options=None)` wrapper returning a minimal `HighlightOutcome` dataclass, layering over the richer spec objects for advanced use.
  - Rationale: Meets user's desire for a one-call experience while keeping room for extensibility via an optional options object if callers need to tweak behaviors later.
  - Alternatives Considered: Replacing the full spec system entirely; rejected to avoid losing advanced capabilities and CLI parity.
- Topic: Options flattening request
  - Decision: Update proposed single-function API to accept explicit keyword args (e.g., `ignore_case`, `regex`, `progressive_kmax`) instead of bundled `HighlightOptions`.
  - Rationale: Keeps the call signature simple while still exposing advanced tuning knobs, aligning with the user's preference.
- Topic: Stateful document API request
  - Decision: Outline a `PdfHighlighter` session object with context-managed lifecycle, accumulating highlights via repeated `.highlight_text(...)` calls before `.save(...)` persists changes.
  - Rationale: Supports batching multiple queries on the same PDF without reopening, matching the user's desired workflow.
- Topic: HighlightOutcome shape
  - Decision: Define `HighlightOutcome` dataclass fields: `matches: int`, `hits: list[HighlightHit]`, `blocked: bool`, `not_found: bool`, `saved_path: Path | None`, `dry_run: bool`, plus optional `report_payload: dict | None` when `report=True`.
  - Rationale: Mirrors CLI exit conditions while keeping the structure lightweight for script consumption.

Summary: Implemented PdfHighlighter session API, single-call wrapper, wired CLI to the new surface, and updated README; validated with `pytest`.
- Topic: Provide runnable sample PDF
  - Decision: Added `examples/sample.pdf` with basic text so README library examples can be executed immediately, and updated English/Japanese docs accordingly.
  - Rationale: Ensures users trying the new API have a ready-made document to test without creating their own.
- Topic: Optional CLI extra in packaging
  - Decision: Moved the console script behind a `[cli]` extra via optional dependency metadata and documented pipx install syntax in both READMEs.
  - Rationale: Allows lightweight library installs while enabling the CLI only when explicitly requested.
- Topic: Simplified mt5 configuration
  - Decision: Removed CLI `--mt5-model`/`--no-mt5` switches, documenting that the tokenizer downloads on first run and reuses cache thereafter.
  - Rationale: Keeps the CLI surface minimal while relying on Hugging Face caching for offline re-use; advanced overrides stay available via environment variables.
- Topic: Renamed CLI entry point
  - Decision: Restored unconditional console script registration and renamed the command to `pdfhl-cli`, updating documentation accordingly.
  - Rationale: Hatchling requires script entries to be plain strings; the new name avoids conflicts while keeping installation simple for users.
- Topic: Version bump for packaging
  - Decision: Raised `__version__` to 0.4.0 to publish the renamed CLI without caching conflicts.
  - Rationale: Ensures pipx installs a fresh wheel so only `pdfhl-cli` is exposed.
- Topic: Expose package version
  - Decision: Re-export `__version__` (with `version` alias) from `pdfhl.__init__` so callers can inspect the installed version directly.
  - Rationale: Matches user expectations (`pdfhl.__version__`) and aids tooling.
- Topic: Torch dependency
  - Decision: Added `torch>=2.0` to the core dependencies so transformer models load without warning and documented the requirement in both READMEs.
  - Rationale: Hugging Face emit warnings without a backend; shipping torch ensures out-of-the-box model availability.
- Topic: Allow-multiple defaults
  - Decision: When `allow_multiple=True`, progressive search now highlights all matches by default (auto `progressive_select_shortest=False`) and docs describe the new behavior.
  - Rationale: Matches CLI expectations (`--all-matches`) and makes the API easier to use without extra knobs.
- Topic: Selection mode API overhaul
  - Decision: Added `SelectionMode` constants (`ERROR`, `BEST`, `ALL`) with a `selection_mode` parameter, plus `MultipleMatchesError`; CLI/recipes now emit explicit modes.
  - Rationale: Makes match-resolution behavior explicit and mirrors the user's requested modes (error, best, all).
- Topic: Highlight count metric
  - Decision: Added `HighlightOutcome.highlight_count` (with legacy `segment_matches` + `matches` alias) to distinguish unique highlights from raw segment matches.
  - Rationale: Users can immediately see how many ranges were highlighted without deduplicating results themselves.
- Topic: Update sample PDF content
  - Decision: Generated `examples/sample.pdf` via pandoc from a markdown source so BEST and ALL examples use distinct phrases; added `examples/sample.md` to keep the source editable.
  - Rationale: Makes README demos clearer by separating single vs multiple-hit phrases and keeps the PDF reproducible.
