# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/pdfhl/`: Main package. Put CLI entry in `src/pdfhl/pdfhl.py`.
- `tests/`: Add `test_*.py` here.
- Root: `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `README.md`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python 3.10+. Follow PEP 8 with 4‑space indentation; add type hints where practical.
- Names: modules/files `snake_case.py`; functions/variables `snake_case`; classes `CamelCase`; constants `UPPER_SNAKE`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: pytest. Focus on pure logic (coordinate transforms, projections, phase angle math).
- Location & names: put tests in `tests/` as `test_*.py`.
- Rendering: skip or mock PyQt5 UI code. Run `pytest` or use the coverage command above.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- Pull requests: include a clear description and rationale; reference issues (e.g., `Closes #123`); add repro/validation steps and screenshots or short clips for UI changes; keep scope small and focused.

### Commit Message Format
- Subject: a single line using Conventional Commits (imperative, concise). Example:
  - `feat: improve robust PDF text matching`
- Body: optional, a few short lines separated by a blank line from the subject. Use bullets for specifics; wrap at ~72 chars.
  - Example:
    - `- Normalize dashes/quotes; collapse line-break hyphenation`
    - `- Add auto phrase-split fallback (order, gap, ratio)`
    - `- Add tests; help epilog`
- Tips:
  - No trailing period in the subject; keep it ≤ 50 chars when possible.
  - Use present tense, active voice ("add", "fix", "update").
  - Reference issues in the body (e.g., `Closes #123`).
  - One logical change per commit; split unrelated changes.

## Session & Design Log (`dev-notes/`)

- File: `dev-notes/session-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Primary Goal: Capture the why behind key decisions made during a session. Design discussions and their outcomes are the main focus.
- Secondary Goal: Supplement decisions with the how by logging relevant command-line transcripts for context, debugging, or reproducibility.

### Logging Format

Entries should use one of the following formats, choosing the one that best fits the context.

#### 1. Design Decision (Default)

- Structure:
  ```markdown
  - Topic: {Brief description of the feature or problem}
    - Decision: A clear and concise summary of the final decision.
    - Rationale: The core reasons why this decision was made. Explain benefits and trade-offs.
    - Alternatives Considered (Optional): Briefly mention other options and why they were not chosen.
  ```

#### 2. Command Transcript (When Necessary)

- Use when specific commands, their sequence, and their output are critical (e.g., troubleshooting, verifying a change).
- Structure:
  ```markdown
  - {Time HH:MM} Ran: `{command}`
    Output:
    ```text
    {A concise excerpt of the output}
    ```
    Result: {Brief one-line explanation of the outcome}
  ```

### General Guidance
- Prioritize logging decisions over raw transcripts; group related command transcripts under a single Topic/Decision when possible.
- Keep outputs concise and redact sensitive info (tokens, secrets, private paths) if they appear.
- At the start of work: create the session file with a short header (date, scope).
- At the end: add a short summary (commits, tags, pushes, follow-ups).
- Optional: If you also capture a full terminal log (`script`, `tee`, etc.), reference the file at the top and paste only key excerpts.

## Decision Safeguards (Strong Stop)
- When a requested change is risky, ambiguous, or conflicts with this guide, the agent must issue a prominent HARD STOP warning with emojis and pause work until explicit confirmation.
- Trigger examples:
  - Ambiguity in requirements or library choice
  - Irreversible/destructive actions (history rewrites, large deletes)
  - Large refactors without tests or clear rollback
  - Security-sensitive or dependency changes without validation
  - Cross‑cutting API changes impacting many files
  - Conflicts with testing conventions or this AGENTS.md
- Process:
  - Post a stop message that summarizes the risk and proposes safer options.
  - Request explicit approval keywords: APPROVE / ADJUST / SPLIT / SKIP.
  - Prefer incremental changes with minimal tests and/or feature flags.
  - Log the decision point and commands in `dev-notes/session-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
  - Example warning:

    ```text
    ⛔️ HARD STOP — Risky/ambiguous change detected
    - Issue: Potentially broad or unclear change could cause breakage.
    - Risk: High scope + unclear intent; potential breakage across components.
    - Proposal: Clarify target behavior, add a minimal test, then proceed incrementally.
    Please reply with:
    - APPROVE to proceed as-is,
    - ADJUST with clarified constraints,
    - SPLIT to stage into smaller PRs, or
    - SKIP to avoid this change.
    ```
  - Scope: Applies to the entire repository. More-nested AGENTS.md files may refine but not weaken these safeguards.
